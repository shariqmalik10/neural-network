# Neural Network Library
This is a neural network library I crated from scratch in order to learn the underlying concepts of neural networks. The library has been created in Python and I have tried my level best to not make use of any external libraries during the process of developing this project except in places where i need to perform mathematical operations such as dot product, sqrt etc.

# Quickstart
1. clone the repo
```shell
git clone git@github.com:shariqmalik10/neural-network.git
```
2. 'cd' over to the folder and check out the <code>examples</code> folder to see how you can make your own neural network using the library !
